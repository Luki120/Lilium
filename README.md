## Features

* A custom calculator for deg to rad conversion & the other way round.

## How to use

* As it is right now it won't compile. First of all, without linking against SpringBoard & SpringBoardHome, the tweak would throw undefined symbols. One would think that linking the frameworks is enough, well it isn't. iOS devs added a check so that if you aren't an 'allowed client' you can't extend classes from private frameworks in a category (which is how Lilium works), so the compilation will stop and tell you exactly that. You can get around it though by just going to `$THEOS/sdks/YOUR_SDK/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/SpringBoard.framework/` and edit the `.tbd` file. At the very top there's a list of allowed clients, you just add the name of the tweak there and it should compile. Same thing for SpringBoardHome.<br>
Cc: Uroboro for suggesting the possibility that such list could be there.
* Slide up the dock and you should see Lilium.
* You can also dismiss it by swiping up the view.
